# Arduino_Drone
This project was created to run on an Arduino Uno controlled drone. The movements of the drone are controlled via an IR (Infared Remote). The drone is equipped with an automatic landing feature which when the landing button is pressed, the drone descends at a certain speed depending on its distance from the ground.
